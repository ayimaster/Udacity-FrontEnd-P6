# Unit Testing with Javascript

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and  wrote their first test suite. Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite.


Within this project I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. Testing the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## To run this application

Clone this repository either by downloading the zip file or via the command line:

``` git clone https://github.com/ayimaster/Udacity-FrontEnd-P6.git ```

Open index.html file in your browser. At the bottom of the page you should be able to see the tests that pass.
